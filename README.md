# Matching Game

Welcome to the repository of my simple matching game! This game is a fun and interactive way to test your memory. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers a challenging experience as you try to match pairs of images on a 4x4 board.

## 🎮 Gameplay

The game board consists of a 4x4 table with 8 pairs of images. These images are randomly positioned and shuffled every time the page is loaded. The objective is to match all pairs as quickly as possible.

### How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Simply load the page to start the game.
2. **Reveal an Image:** Click on a tile to reveal the image underneath.
3. **Match the Pair:** Click on another tile to see if the images match.
   - **Matched:** If they match, the tiles are disabled from the board.
   - **Not Matched:** If they don't, a "Continue" button appears below the board. Clicking this will turn the tiles face down again.
4. **Winning:** The game is won when all image pairs are matched and all tiles are disabled from the board.
